# dataScraper
## Data scraper made in Python with libraries like:<br>
- BeautifulSoup<br>

## Roadmap:<br>
- Allowing scraping only specific things(for ex.Only about python, in some specific date range).<br>
- Making the scraper use some random delays to imitate human activity.<br>
- Scraping more informations that only specific one(for ex.titles,authors,links and date of publishing the article).<br>
- Multithread scraping to scrape more efficiently a lot of pages and more data at the same time.<br>
- Making the scraper jump between pages to not stop after the first one.<br>
- Making a GUI.<br>
